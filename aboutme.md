title: About Me
---

I'm Mackenzie Lee, a recent University of Rochester graduate with a B.S. in Data Science. While I enjoy the usual travel, outdoors, hiking and requently acquired jiu jitsu and baking, the focus of this whole site is my professional side, an aspect that needs some cultivating. By professional, I'm talking about data science specifically. You see, despite my degree and even some work experience, I have no confidence in saying I'm a data scientist. That's gonna change.  


### Origin Story

Since the summer after my sophomore year, I've been at the same company since I first got a comfortable internship, which led to a full-time job. However, that comfort led to some stagnant growth in the technical department and I can safely say I've fallen behind. I am not blaming my employer, but myself for getting complacent. In today's technological world where learning resources have never been more plentiful, I've seen so many stories of self-taught and driven individuals becoming data scientists. It's been both inspiring and disheartening honestly. But I needed to know! I began trying to live a productive life and living up to my inherit potential as a human, but work and career were never a part of that. I started exercising, eating well, and even wasting less time on pointless apps and websites, but my career was always an afterthought. Now that I think about it, I know it was because I convinced myself I would eventually get better somehow, but just didn't want to put in that effort at the time. That really worked out. If you're gonna do something, then do it well. I'm a big believer in that and now I see so clearly that it's finally time to apply it to my career, to data science!

Don't misunderstand me. I'm still all about work life balance and the work to live mentality, but if I want to live up to that belief, then my work needs to be a part of that. I hate the unfulfilling dejection of getting rewarded, congratulated, or worse, recognized for things you know aren't as they seem. Working full-time and getting my first pay check was a big wake up call that I was doing exactly that. Yeah, maybe I was doing what they wanted me to at the time adequately enough, but I know I could be better. Working full-time gave me a new breath of motivation to stop this pathetic charade and get to it. Well, I am.
