title: The Beginning
---

I plan on restarting. I have a degree in data science, but I will say that I don't think it helped me much. It was a newer degree program, so whoever organized the curriculum may not have known the best approach at the time and I know it's already gotten better since I've graduated, but that doesn't change the fact that it didn't help me much. After countless hours browsing online resources, I decided to just stick with a 100% free approach so no Udacity or any of those nanodegree programs. I got my degree. I just want to ensure it means something and I'm positive there's enough on the internet for that. Eventually, I settled on following a plan set in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTxyviU0Ddo). I already went through a good chunk of his proposed plan in college (programming, linear algebra, etc.), but I want to _really_ understand the material now. I'm gonna start from the beginning and do it again, but do it right this time. On the bright side, I think I will save some time from the past experience I've had. I even have a project or two I could throw up on my empty GitHub page, but I'll think about that stuff after I get rolling. It was thanks to him that I even made this site. I was just going to jump straight into it, but he convinced me and I think this'll be a good idea. 

While he had a great plan, I plan on adapting it a bit so it's more suited to my needs. My focus is  on Python and much more on projects rather than math. I have taken all those classes already, but I still want to go back through it. That's another thing. I've probably 'learned' so many of these things 20 times already, but they've just never stuck.

This is my current plan, which will probably change as I get a feel for the material and my own aptitude. I don't have a set timeline, since I'm unsure of how busy I'll be, but I would like to finish all this in a reasonable time frame. If you compare his plan to mine, you'll have noticed I removed most of the math books. A good thing I learned from college is what works for me, so I'll adapt as needed to save time. I also will do some of these simultaneously as I think that will make sense in some cases. For example, I'll probably start with the Python basics, but also be looking at the linear algebra material at the same time. In general, the plan will be to finish all the math first and hopefully by that point I'll have finished the Python basics. Afterwards, I'll take that Harvard class then do the data visualization section. At this point, I should be decent at the very least I hope. I'll probably try some independent 'capstone' project to mark a significant milestone in the course as well and get the portfolio started. The focus now will really be honing data science skills, which means much more Python and getting into the heavier computer science materials. I'll then begin the Python data science specifics before really beginning the practice Python projects. Once all this is said and done, a significant amount of time may have passed, but my skills should have grown accordingly (man, I really hope). I will just be trying a bunch of projects after that. I count the rest of the material as extras if I have time. I actually feel comfortable with SQL, but TensorFlow and Git are things I think will be better learned when I use them or I may even look at those resources in a project. 

I'll preface the end of this by saying I have done a lot of this already like Git, Python, and these math topics, but the reason I'm starting over is because I want to build quality projects where I know every bit. I don't expect to walk out a master of data science, but I think doing this in addition to my job will be the end to this feeling of inadequacy. Luckily, I'm at a company that supports my training, so I may be able to do some of these things at work even to save time, but I will try my best to finish the Python basics and math in a month or two. Math has never been my strongpoint, so if I'm at a feeling of good understanding, I'll call it a day there. The focus is on the applicable skills and things like math can always be reviewed when the relevant model arises. 

My end goal is really to have a good, well-rounded portfolio showcasing my data science capabilities, so I'll do what I need to do to get there. That may mean shortcuts in some areas or extra long times for others. I am excited, nervous, and frustrated to start this, but I gotta do it. One thing I learned from all my prior self-teaching attempts is that it's easy to just let the material fly by you. It takes a lot of effort, especially from videos, to absorb it. Watching the video to the end doesn't mean you got the material down. I can't treat this like a checkbox and say it's done, moving on. It's all related and it's what makes a data scientist. I'm a lil' older now and I think even a lil' wiser. I gotta do it for my company to let them know they didn't hire a clown, but more importantly for me to let me know I'm not a clown.
